## About

This is mod for Minecraft 1.20.2 that allows you to grow, craft, and brew your own custom teas in Minecraft.

## Getting Started

During your explorations of the world, you will be able to find the various ingredients you can use to make your own teas. Many of the ingredients can be grown using seeds found by breaking grass. However, bergamot trees only generate rarely in forest biomes. You can get bergamot oranges rarely by breaking leaves.

To craft your custom teas, you will need either tea leaves or mint as a tea base. You can then craft the base and up to 4 other unique ingredients together to create your own loose leaf tea. 

Next, to brew your teas, you will need your own teapot. This can be crafted using 8 clay blocks in a furnace shape. You will then need to fire your teapot in a furnace.

The teapot can then be used to brew your newly crafted loose leaf teas. Just place a loose leaf tea and fuel in the top and bottom slots respectively, and fill it with water using a bucket. If the fuel and tea is valid, it will begin to brew automatically. 

You can then remove your tea from the pot by clicking on the pot using a mug. Brewed tea gives different beneficial effects based on the ingredients used. Experiment with different ingredients to see what effects they produce!

You can also add milk and sugar to already brewed teas. Adding milk provides a curing affect, similar to drinking a bucket of milk, and adding a sugar cube will increase the strength of the effects given by the tea.
